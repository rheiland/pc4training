<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>
This app provides a general purpose PhysiCell workbench that lets you compile/run models and visualize results.
</p>

<p>This model and cloud-hosted demo are part of a course on computational multicellular systems biology created and taught by 
    Dr. Paul Macklin in the Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering at Indiana University. It is also part of the education 
    and outreach for the IU Engineered nanoBIO Node and the NCI-funded cancer systems biology grant U01CA232137. 
    The models are built using <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005991" target="_blank">PhysiCell</a>: 
    a C++ framework for multicellular systems biology [1].</p>

<p>In the &quot;Terminal&quot; tab, go to the directory where your PhysiCell model is located. 
Compile your model (typically, just build the example models as described in the Quickstart guide) and run it.</p>

<p>In the dropdown directory widget, select the output directory containing your model's results.</p>

<p>Click the &quot;Out: Plots&quot; tab to visualize the results in the output directory. Choose a substrate from the drop-down menu, 
and slide through the saved times. As the simulation runs, the &quot;max&quot; field (maximum frame number) will increase, 
so you can view more simulation frames.</p>

<p>Note that you can download output data for further exploration in your tools of choice.</p>
